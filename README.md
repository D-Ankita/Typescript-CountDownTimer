# Typescript-CountDownTimer
Count down timer  MD is a Simple Count down timer . Typescript was used to build this project. This App was developed at the very beginning of learning Typescript.

Plain CSS is used for styling.This project is not complete (as no web app could ever be sufficiently called complete) as we could always enhance the existing feature, fix bugs and add new features. I plan to revisit this project when I want to try something new.

This project is hosted on [Github Pages](https://github.com/D-Ankita/Typescript-CountDownTimer).

## About this Project
One can type his day to day expenses in the `Description` feild, Amount Spent in the `Amount` feild and Date of Expense in the `Date` Feild and Add it using `Add` button.

The Expense when added will be displayed in form of a card.

Additionally there is a `Clear All` option on the Right Corner which will help to erase all the entries at once.
